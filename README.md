================================================
For you guys information: this is just a copy version of ERP Next but much worse. We have assignments about recreating the some feature in ERP Next
Here is the original link to the website: https://erpnext.com/open-source-crm

In order to use this, you must have Xampp program fisrt to import the database and run the php files.
After download and setup Xampp completed, you just have to move this assignment in xampp/htdocs file.
Finally type localhost/(name of the file) on browser
Choose the muctieu1.php and there you go

+ Update 13/11/2024:
i feel hopeless for my future. My code is much messier than before. Im adding the php for the second table but it kinda similar to first table in muctieu1.php file
